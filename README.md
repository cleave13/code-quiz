# Code Quiz

## Description

This code quiz application is my first stab at a single-page application using javascript. I created this quiz app from scratch including all content, html and css.

The prompt for this assignment allowed me to apply the following elements from my classroom learnings:

- manipulating and inserting DOM elements using javascript
- setting element attributes
- using timers
- incorporating external fonts
- evaluating conditional logic
- looping over elements in an array
- leverage local storage for persistent data from one session to the next

By the end of this exercise, I feel much more comfortable with each of the elements above.

## Access the application
